Thanks to alexguirre for extracting new PTFX and uploading it.
You can find it here: https://gist.github.com/alexguirre/af70f0122957f005a5c12bef2618a786

Replace "Particles Effects Dump.txt" with the data found in that link
and then use "ptfx_dump" in the GTA V cheat console to add new PTFX to the menu.

Lastly, you can also use the "Dump PTFX info" option in the script (found under each Asset menu)
to do an extra dump on that asset to get any missing Evolution parameters.
